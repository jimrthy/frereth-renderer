# frereth-renderer

I keep running into brick walls trying to get a Common Lisp
version working. Try it with clojure instead.

## Installation

Clone this repository for github. Update your project.clj and copy
the src directory from this one into yours.

No, it ain't pretty. But it's a start.

## Usage

Beats me. I'm making this up as I go.

    $ java -jar frereth-renderer-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
